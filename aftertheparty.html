<h2>The Story of Christopher's Moon Daisies (Album Coming Soon)</h2>

   <p class = 'text'> <!--paragraph 1-->
      Mid 2019, I sat around thinking about the few months I had spent living at 37 Stanley 
      Avenue, the house second from the end of a very long redbrick terrace in Rusholme, 
      Manchester. I wrote the words to a song, No.37, and put with the others I was planning
      to record one day. These songs and the people in them are all real. It’s basically my
      equivalent of a personal diary. I wanted to do them all with full instrumentation just to
      get more power out them. I have quite a short attention span with music and with just a 
      guitar or piano and singing, there is usually not enough going on for me. It was a lot of 
      fun to play, and that's really the only point of doing it. After a bit of messing around with 
      the recording equipment and recording a few demos, in late 2019 I started trying to make
      a few songs properly.

      I had a song called My Love recorded in 2018 that was played on BBC Radio, 
       which was pretty cool.

      For the cover artwork, I don’t know anything 
       about what makes a good picture, which led me to contact a really excellent artist in 
       Copenhagen. Em is a musician too in fact, as the singer of Atomic Blue, as well as an
       idiosyncratic photographer. I think he is few years older than me, because he just seems
        like a fairly wise owl.<br>
       <br>
       A few songs are set in the past tense, or at least drawn very linearly from 
       experiences. Sometimes situations that we are immersed in are not what they seem at the 
       time. When you are so close to something you can’t picture its entirety, and it takes time
        to realise its significance. I think this process is what makes the past easiest to write 
        about for me. There is often a disconnected percolation of ideas in songs relating to the 
        here and now but this isn’t an artistic choice for effect its just how life is. The past 
        has certain dimensions in time and amplitude and words can’t replace. 
        This thought has made me more careful with words, because you can never truly take them 
        back, but then also you can never replace the way you felt at a certain time.
